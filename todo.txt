Issues: 
- GUI: wave view overflow
- envelope: audio glitches during transition to sustain and on note stealing during release
- wave offload does not work

Features:
- envelope looping
- extra envelope
- extra LFO
- LFO: binaural phase difference
- legato/slew limiter
- better filter
- envelope to mixer mod connection at startup

Modifications:
- Use single process for wave offload and continuously update sampled wave when idle
- combine unison and binaural oscillators when calculating spreads

Optimizations:
table interpolator: frame indices and positions are calculated for every voice in parallel while ony one is uses each cycle

Open Problems:
- integrating midi velocity in the voice mixer
