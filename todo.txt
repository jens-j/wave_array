Issues: 
- GUI: wave view overflow
- Envelope does not re-trigger on note stealing
- clicking when a note is re-triggered during the release
- GUI: reading back negative parameters fails

Features:
- envelope looping
- extra envelope
- extra LFO
- LFO: binaural phase difference
- legato/slew limiter
- better filter
- LFO: delayed start
- ring modulator 
- LFO: single cycle mode (only in trigger mode)
- Better mod matrix GUI
- more waveforms 
- n_frames in waveform name
- high frequency LFO mode
- Step like frame interpolation
- filter: allow filter to open further

Optimizations:
- LFO: use smaller phase accumulator to allow natural overflow
- Replace output buffers by using accumulators e.g. directly.
- Table address generator can be unified

Open Problems:
- integrating midi velocity in the voice mixer
