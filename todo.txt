Issues: 
- GUI: wave view overflow
- GUI: reading back negative parameters fails
- Testbench UART reader does not handle error replies well
- LFO: negative phase has issues
- LFO: sine overflow on max value sometimes
* voices can remain on if switching from binaural mode
- software reset does not work well

Features:
- envelope looping
- legato/slew limiter
- better filter
- LFO: delayed start
- ring modulator 
- LFO: single cycle mode (only in trigger mode)
- Better mod matrix GUI
- more waveforms 
- n_frames in waveform name
- high frequency LFO mode
- Step like frame interpolation
- filter: allow filter to open further
- oscillators as mod source -> need to swap unison- and table-mixers.
- noise source

Optimizations:
- LFO: use smaller phase accumulator to allow natural overflow
- Replace output buffers by using accumulators e.g. directly.
- Table address generator can be unified

Open Problems:
- integrating midi velocity in the voice mixer (mapping to sustain works)
